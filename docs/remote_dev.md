Remote development & port forwarding

- In a Remote-SSH session you can forward a remote port to your local machine using the VS Code Ports view ("Forward a Port"). Forward the remote PORT (see /etc/calb-sizingtool/<env>.env for PORT) to a local port and then open http://localhost:<local-port> in your browser.
